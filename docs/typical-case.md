# Upgrade to Vue 3 by vue-codemod

## Summary

It has been half a year since the release of Vue 3, meanwhile, LTS support for Vue 2 will be phased out in 18 months. How to migrate the existing Vue 2 project to Vue 3 has become an issue of concern to everyone. Although Vue.js team has released a detailed migration guidance, the workload of source code upgrade and migration in practical projects is relatively large. To reduce repetitive work, we recommend a migration tool called [originjs/vue-codemod](https://github.com/originjs/vue-codemod), which can directly upgrade most of the Vue 2 syntax to Vue 3 syntax. With `vue-codemod` transformation and a small amount of manual modification, users can complete the smooth migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3.

> ⚠️Attention: Since the [`vue-codemod`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-codemod) from Vue.js team has not been maintained for some time, the following repo is forked from Vue.js team. We are continuing to develop new features in the fork repo.

Demo project address：[vue2-element-touzi-admin](https://github.com/originjs/vue2-element-touzi-admin/tree/to-vue3)

## Global Install `vue-codemod`

```bash
npm install originjs/vue-codemod -g`
// or
yarn add originjs/vue-codemod -g
```

## Migration Steps

### Step1：[Upgrade the source code by `vue-codemod`](https://github.com/originjs/vue2-element-touzi-admin/commit/21aeb41bf8595a7a6323a92ed9326cec4c7f5955)

> ⚠️Attention: `vue-codemod` modify the file in the source path. If you haven't use version control tools like Git or SVN, please back up your code in advance.

Command：

```bash
vue-codemod src -a
```

First we apply `vue-codemod` to auto upgrade the source code. Hers is the transformation log. Users can figure out which rules was executed and which files are modified.

```cmd
vue-codemod src -a

### Step 2：[Upgrade elment-ui to element-plus](https://github.com/originjs/vue2-element-touzi-admin/commit/8cddf35dcf04165fbf997e378205c5428dcb5e7f)

The biggest limitation of Vue 3 migration is the dependencies. If some components in your source code don't support Vue 3, we suggest your project remain unchanged until the Vue 3 supported version release.

### Step 3：[Fix errors or warnings from Global API](https://github.com/originjs/vue2-element-touzi-admin/commit/c1a7288299f80e23d5b1ad32f111ee10564ad8bd)

In some practical projects, we find some Global API can not be modified precisely, which need to be modified manually according to the warning message from console

### Step 4：[Fix errors or warnings from Vue router](https://github.com/originjs/vue2-element-touzi-admin/commit/a5c95632e44877360be95014e74229ab13e50664)

`vue-codemod` can migrate most of Vue router 3 syntax to router 4, but there are still some breaking change need to be modified manually according to our manual migration guide.

### Step 5：[Fix warnings in browser](https://github.com/originjs/vue2-element-touzi-admin/commit/7a123320a0d0edf32baa09534c2f7df6664ec730)

At this moment the whole project is runnable. We can also fix some warnings from the browser to make it run more gracefully.
